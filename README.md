# Hello Again!ðŸ˜Š

## Overview

The challenge I had in coding this project was probably trying to make it responsive due to the background and the images being in peculiar places for both the desktop and mobile. I used a few resources to get the JavaScript to work and try to fully understand the logic in making the accordion, which made me more confident in using DOM. Overall, it took a while but it was a very enjoyable project to code!
